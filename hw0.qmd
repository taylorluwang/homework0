This report calculates the solutions to the quadratic equation ax\^2 + bx + c = 0 for given values of a, b, and c.

The plot below displays the quadratic equation, along with a line at y = 0 so that we can visualize the solutions.

```{r}
solve_formula <- function(a, b, c){
  if(b^2-4*a*c < 0){
    print(paste0("There are no real solutions to: ", a, "x^2 + ", b, "x + ", c, " = 0"))
  }
  else{
    solution_1 <- ((-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c))/(2*a))
    solution_2 <- ((-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c))/(2*a))
    if(solution_1 == solution_2){
      print(paste0("The solution to ", a, "x^2 + ", b, "x + ", c, " = 0 is ", solution_1))
    }
    else{
      print(paste0("The solutions to ", a, "x^2 + ", b, "x + ", c, " = 0 are ", solution_1, " and ", solution_2, "."))
      }
    
    x <- seq(-3, 3, length = 300)
    plot(x, a*x^2 + b*x + c, type = "l", main = "Plot of: ax^2 + bx + c = 0", ylab = "F(x)")
    abline(h = 0, lty = 2)
  }
}

solve_formula(1, 3, 2)
```
